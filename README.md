# Fixed Income Pricing Engine

## Overview

The Fixed Income Pricing Engine is a proof of concept project aimed at implementing a simplified fixed income pricing system. It includes modules for data input, yield curve modeling, pricing models, risk metrics, user interaction, and basic visualization.

## Features

- Data input from various sources (e.g., files, user input).
- Yield curve modeling using the Nelson-Siegel model.
- Pricing models for fixed income instruments (e.g., bonds, swaps).
- Calculation of risk metrics (e.g., duration, convexity).
- User-friendly command-line interface for data input and interaction.
- Basic text-based data visualization.

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (Apple clang version 14.0.0 )
- Python (3.10.9)
- Visual Studio Code (or your preferred IDE)
- Git
